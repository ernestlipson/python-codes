    "\n",
    "    Certain functions, such as int or str, return a value that can be used later.\n",
    "    To do this for your defined functions, you can use the return statement.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Comments are annotations to code used to make it easier to understand. They don't affect how code is run.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Docstrings (documentation strings) serve a similar purpose to comments, as they are designed to explain code. However, they are more specific and have a different syntax. They are created by putting a multiline string containing an explanation of the function below the function's first line.\n",
    "    Unlike conventional comments, docstrings are retained throughout the runtime of the program. This allows the programmer to inspect these comments at run time."

    "    The last type is called the standard library, and contains many useful modules. Some of the standard library's useful modules include string, re, datetime, math, random, os, multiprocessing, subprocess, socket, email, json, doctest, unittest, pdb, argparse and sys.\n",

    "### Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "    They occur when something goes wrong, due to incorrect code or input. When an exception occurs, the program immediately stops.\n",
    "    Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "    Different exceptions are raised for different reasons.\n",
    "    Common exceptions:\n",
    "    ImportError: an import fails;\n",
    "    IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number;\n",
    "    NameError: an unknown variable is used;\n",
    "    SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly;\n",
    "    TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;\n",
    "    ValueError: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but with an inappropriate value.\n",
    "    Python has several other built-in exceptions, such as ZeroDivisionError and OSError. Third-party libraries also often define their own exceptions.\n",
    "    \n",
    " ###   Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "    To handle exceptions, and to call code when an exception occurs, you can use a try/except statement.\n",
    "    The try block contains code that might throw an exception. If that exception occurs, the code in the try block stops being executed, and the code in the except block is run. If no error occurs, the code in the except block doesn't run.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A try statement can have multiple different except blocks to handle different exceptions.\n",
    "    Multiple exceptions can also be put into a single except block using parentheses, to have the except block handle all of them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An except statement without any exception specified will catch all errors. These should be used sparingly, as they can catch unexpected errors and hide programming mistakes.\n",
    "    \n",
    " ###   finally\n",
    "\n",
    "    To ensure some code runs no matter what errors occur, you can use a finally statement. The finally statement is placed at the bottom of a try/except statement. Code within a finally statement always runs after execution of the code in the try, and possibly in the except, blocks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You can raise exceptions by using the raise statement."

    "####    FILES IN PYTHON\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can use Python to read and write the contents of files.\n",
    "    Text files are the easiest to manipulate. Before a file can be edited, it must be opened, using the open function. myfile = open(\"filename.txt\")\n",
    "    The argument of the open function is the path to the file. If the file is in the current working directory of the program, you can specify only its name.\n",
    "    You can specify the mode used to open a file by applying a second argument to the open function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Sending \"r\" means open in read mode, which is the default.\n",
    "    Sending \"w\" means write mode, for rewriting the contents of a file.\n",
    "    Sending \"a\" means append mode, for adding new content to the end of the file.\n",
    "    Adding \"b\" to a mode opens it in binary mode, which is used for non-text files (such as image and sound files).\n",
    "    \n",
    " ####   Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "    To read only a certain amount of a file, you can provide a number as an argument to the read function.. This determines the number of bytes that should be read.\n",
    "    You can make more calls to read on the same file object to read more of the file byte by byte. With no argument, read returns the rest of the file. file = open(\"filename.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    print(file.read(16))\n",
    "    print(file.read(4))\n",
    "    print(file.read(4))\n",
    "    print(file.read())\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Just like passing no arguments, negative values will return the entire contents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To retrieve each line in a file, you can use the readlines method to return a list in which each element is a line in the file.\n",
    "    You can also use a for loop to iterate through the lines in the file\n",
    "    In the output, the lines are separated by blank lines, as the print function automatically adds a new line at the end of its output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  #### Writing Files\n",
    "  \n",
    "      To write to files you use the write method, which writes a string to the file.\n",
    "      The \"w\" mode will create a file, if it does not already exist.\n",
    "      file = open(\"newfile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "                file.write(\"This has been written to a file\")\n",

    "                print(file.read())\n",
    "                file.close()\n",
    "       When a file is opened in write mode, the file's existing content is deleted.\n",
    "       The write method returns the number of bytes written to a file, if successful.\n",
    "       To write something other than a string, it needs to be converted to a string first.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       It is good practice to avoid wasting resources by making sure that files are always closed after they have been used. One way of doing this is to use try and finally.\n",
    "               try:\n",
    "                   f = open(\"filename.txt\")\n",
    "                   print(f.read())\n",
    "               finally:\n",
    "                   f.close()\n",
    "    This ensures that the file is always closed, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "    An alternative way of doing this is using with statements. This creates a temporary variable (often called f), which is only accessible in the indented block of the with statement. \n",
    "                with open(\"filename.txt\") as f:\n",
    "                   print(f.read())\n",
